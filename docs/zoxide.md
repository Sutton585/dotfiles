## Configuration

### Flags

When calling `zoxide init`, the following flags are available:

- `--cmd`
  - Changes the prefix of the `z` and `zi` commands.
  - `--cmd j` would change the commands to (`j`, `ji`).
  - `--cmd cd` would replace the `cd` command.
- `--hook <HOOK>`
  - Changes how often zoxide increments a directory's score:

    | Hook            | Description                       |
    | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
    | `none`          | Never                             |
    | `prompt`        | At every shell prompt             |
    | `pwd` (default) | Whenever the directory is changed |

- `--no-cmd`
  - Prevents zoxide from defining the `z` and `zi` commands.
  - These functions will still be available in your shell as `__zoxide_z` and
    `__zoxide_zi`, should you choose to redefine them.

### Environment variables

Environment variables[^2] can be used for configuration. They must be set before
`zoxide init` is called.

- `_ZO_DATA_DIR`
  - Specifies the directory in which the database is stored.
  - The default value varies across OSes:

    | OS          | Path                                                   | Example                                           |
    | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
    | Linux / BSD | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/zoxide` or `$HOME/.local/share/zoxide` | `/home/alice/.local/share/zoxide`                 |
    | macOS       | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/zoxide`             | `/Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/zoxide` |
    | Windows     | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\zoxide`                                | `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Local\zoxide`             |

- `_ZO_ECHO`
  - When set to 1, `z` will print the matched directory before navigating to
    it.
- `_ZO_EXCLUDE_DIRS`
  - Excludes the specified directories from the database.
  - This is provided as a list of [globs][glob], separated by OS-specific
    characters:

    | OS                  | Separator | Example                 |
    | ------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
    | Linux / macOS / BSD | `:`       | `$HOME:$HOME/private/*` |
    | Windows             | `;`       | `$HOME;$HOME/private/*` |

  - By default, this is set to `"$HOME"`.
- `_ZO_FZF_OPTS`
  - Custom options to pass to [fzf] during interactive selection. See
    [`man fzf`][fzf-man] for the list of options.
- `_ZO_MAXAGE`
  - Configures the [aging algorithm][algorithm-aging], which limits the maximum
    number of entries in the database.
  - By default, this is set to 10000.
- `_ZO_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS`
  - When set to 1, `z` will resolve symlinks before adding directories to the
    database.
